* What is a charge density wave (CDW)?
- In low dimentional metals at low temperature, CDW is a coupled modulation of conduction electron density and the atomic positions
- Metals undergo a phase transition when they are cooled.
- i.e. iron and nickel become FM. Lead and Al become superconductors
- Since 1970s, many metals with reduced dimentionality have been found to undergo a different type of a phase transition called CDW
- And studying this behavior has been one of the interests of condensed matter physics

* Formulation of CDWs
- In 1955, Rudolf Peierls ('pai-earlz)
- The modulations have wavelength of pi / k_F,
- consider a metal chain
- the allowed conduction electrons form a band
- states with k < k_F are occupied
- gap at k = \pm k_F, the energy of occupied states below e_F will be lower, and a prefered ground state
- how is the gap produced? too detailed explanation by Frohlich and Peierls

* Goal: find how phonons change in the presense of CDW
- CDWs are pretty common in superconducting cuprates
- But they have different wave vectors
- Finding unifying descirption for superconducing cuprates is not easy
- Miao and Dean's paper: study how phonons change at different temperature

- Q: why care only about low energy phonons

- Q: Does "214"-cuprates mean X2CuO4?

- Q: What does "the different ordering wave vectors" mean?
La2CuO4 and YBCO?

- CDW is a periodic motion of charge density that results from distortion of the crystal lattice.
    Q: does that mean CDW always occurs?
    Q: CDW is a kind of spin ordering?
    Q: CDW = Flip?

Q: What is incommensurability? (0.3, 0)
"with an incommensurability that appears locked to the spin
density wave (SDW) correlations around (0.375,0.5) (i.e.,
with an incommensurability of 1/8 relative to the antiferromagnetic
wave vector)"
Q: When CDW and SDW are not of the same periodicity (or a rational multiple), they are called incommensurate?


# It is sometimes more energetically favorable for electrons to take this configuration, and the atoms follow suit.

- S(Q, omege) but plot omega vs K = Qy
    Q: is K the same as Q?

Q: why they did it?
A: because they can

Q: What is phonon dynamic susceptibility, X(Q, omega)? they measured X
Q: Why calculate it?

Q: How does phonon softening imply CDW?

Q: Are La2CuO4 quasi-two-dimentional?

Q: How are these two related?
    - Me: Use CRYSTAL to diagonalize the dynamical matrices
    - Paper: Find S(Q, omega) supposed to have peaks
    fourier transform of correlation function

Q: How does plotting hole charge density tell us anything about CDW?

zero mode (didn't scatter)
doping weakens the Sr-O bond

Q: What is short-ranged CDW correlation?

Q: What is phonon broadening
A: peak
